Analysis of Solid Waste Management Data All over India using Power BI

https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/e86398dd-18e8-4f49-a858-37206a2e0f00/ReportSection?ctid=bc8e40c5-13b3-483b-9847-bf91f6e191bb

The data contained the response values for 96 cities for different questions under 5 themes namely Energy, Mobility, Urban Planning, Waste Management & Water Resource Management

The dashboard was built to allow user to select, compare and analyse the different cities on different parameters (questions). 
The user should also have the flexibility to select a group of cities based on population, area buckets created for the analysis.
For example: - Population buckets of 0-1 Million, 1-3 Million, 3-5 Million, 5 Million+, etc.

•	Given Data source was imported into Power BI. 
•	Loaded India-Census dataset to get the population of the cities.
•	Mapping was done between these 2 tables by City Column
•	Interactive Visualizations were then created using various features in Power BI – filtering, Tree map, Pie Chart and Slicers

Data wrangling using Power BI

PowerBI was used as an ETL tool. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is an automated process which takes raw data, extracts the information required for analysis, transforms it into a format that can serve business needs, and loads it to a data warehouse. 

•	Step 1: Cleaning the data (data formatting, standardize the values in column)
•	Step 2: Feature Engineering (Extract the new features from the existing features if necessary) 
•	Step 3: Data formatting (transform data from long to wide and vice versa. For example, we want to reshape the data and create a pivot table that converts values from a single column into multiple columns)
•	 Step 4: Finding Duplicates (Understand whether the identical records are actually duplicates that are created by mistake. Identical records could be legitimate as well. If the identical records are not legitimate remove them)
•	Step 5: Outlier detection (If outlier is detected perform outlier treatment)
•	Step 6: Finding Missing values (If any missing values in the dataset perform imputation method)
•	Step 7: check data normalization (If data is not normally distributed perform transformations such as log, square root, reciprocal, exponential and box-cox transformation)

The tool was developed using Advanced VBA for filtering out specific calls for troubleshooting and producing data visualizations (call volume, dropped calls,
fraudulent calls, trunk utilizations, signalling info, voice quality analysis and many others)

Market Basket Analysis (MBA) shows what combinations of products most frequently occur together in orders. These relationships can be used to increase profitability through cross-selling, promotions, and providing combo offers on a menu.
Pareto Chart per Category based on the 80/20 Rule (also known as the Pareto Principle) is a formula stating that 80% of sales are made by 20% of items. Using this principle, items that are at the bottom of sales can be removed to increase profitability.
